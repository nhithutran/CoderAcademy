### Q1 
Source control helps to track and manage changes to code on your local computer or when collaborating with others. When working in a company setting with multiple Teams and for a large project, consistent source control management tool and process is very important for maintaning a single source of truth for the developemt team.  It allows developers to work in the same code, commit and merge their code without conflict (Gehman C, Sept. 2019).

As there can be mutliple developers working on the same code, prior to working on a project a developer best pulls the latest version of the code so they can work on your local independently. When you are ready with your changes you can git add and commit on your local repository. All history and details to your changes you made and tracked. This information will be useful if code conflicts or problems such as bugs is introduced. If there are any changes from other contributors, you can also pull in their code into your local repository to check there is no issues before pushing your commits and merging your changes back into the main version of the repository (Atlassian Bitbucket, viewed 15 Jun 2022).
