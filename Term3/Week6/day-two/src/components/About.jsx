      <h3>Greeting</h3>
      <p>
        I am Fateen. If ever a problem clouds your brow, you shall come to me.
        Mr. Duking, this town's leader, took my fortune-telling to heart. He
        searched high and low for the wild Pokémon I had foretold. His search
        has been rewarded. He appears to have found several locations where wild
        Pokémon appear.
